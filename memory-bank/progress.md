# Progress: Ops-Core Python Module

## 1. What Works (Current Status)
- **Project Setup:** The `ops-core` workspace is active. Virtual environment (`.venv`) created and dependencies installed. Git repository initialized and connected to remote.
- **Planning Context:** All initial planning documents reviewed. Memory bank initialized. Unit testing plan created.
- **Technology Selection:** FastAPI confirmed. Pytest configured with asyncio, mock, and cov plugins.
- **Core Modules Implemented:**
    - Storage (`storage.py`): In-memory implementation using models, thread-safe, uses custom exceptions. (Test coverage updated)
    - Lifecycle (`lifecycle.py`): Agent registration, state management, session tracking implemented using models and custom exceptions. (100% test coverage)
    - Workflow (`workflow.py`): Definition loading, task queuing (in-memory), agent state check before dispatching, placeholder dispatching (async, connected to client), placeholder error handling implemented, uses custom exceptions. (Test coverage updated)
    - Logging (`logging_config.py`): Structured JSON logging configured. (Test coverage needs review)
    - Models (`models.py`): Core Pydantic models defined and used. (Test coverage needs review)
    - AgentKit Client (`agentkit_client.py`): Placeholder created. (Test coverage needs review)
    - Exceptions (`exceptions.py`): Custom exception hierarchy defined and fully integrated with all core modules.
- **API Endpoints (`api.py`):** `/health`, `POST /v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/state`, `GET /v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/state`, `/v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/workflow`, `POST /v1/opscore/internal/agent/notify` implemented, using custom exceptions with proper HTTP status code mappings. (Test coverage needs update)
- **Unit Tests:** Test suite expanded for storage, lifecycle, workflow, and API modules using pytest. Tests for lifecycle, workflow, storage updated for custom exceptions. (Need to re-run after recent changes).
- **Integration Tests (Mock AgentKit):** Tests rewritten (`tests/test_agentkit_integration.py`) using `pytest-asyncio` and `httpx` to cover webhook registration and state update callbacks. Passing.
- **Integration Tests (Real AgentKit):** Setup complete (`docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml`, `tests/simulated_agent/`, `tests/integration/test_real_agentkit_workflow.py`). Implemented Redis storage backend and refactored Ops-Core to use async storage (`storage.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `api.py`). Updated test fixtures (`conftest.py`) and test logic (`test_real_agentkit_workflow.py`, `simulated_agent/main.py`) to handle Redis and async operations. **Test `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` now passes.** (Task 4.2 Completed - 2025-04-20)
- **Python SDK (`opscore_sdk/`):** Sync and async clients implemented with basic API coverage (state update/get, workflow trigger). Unit tests added using `pytest-httpx`.
- **CLI Application (`opscore_cli/`):** Basic CLI implemented using `click` with commands for state and workflow interaction. Unit tests added and passing.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps from `TASK.md`)
- **Phase 2 Tasks:**
    - [ ] **Task 2.9:** Develop a basic CLI or web dashboard for real‑time log inspection and filtering.
    - [ ] **Task 2.10:** Incorporate performance tracing methods like `startTrace(taskId)` and `endTrace(taskId)`.

        - [X] Task 4.2: Develop integration tests simulating complete workflows. (Completed: Debugged and fixed integration test failures related to API key handling, simulated agent state reporting payload, and test logic race conditions. Test `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` now passes. - 2025-04-20)
        - [ ] Task 4.3: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (testing, linting).
        - [ ] **Task 4.4:** Perform performance and load testing on API endpoints. (Minimal load test Scenario 0 completed successfully; Scenarios 1 & 2 blocked by agent registration failures - 2025-04-21)
        - [ ] Task 4.5: Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
- **Phase 5 Tasks:** Documentation updates (`README.md`, API docs, tutorials, config guide).
- **Backlog:** Persistent storage/queue, advanced debugging/security, async messaging, etc.

## 3. Current Status Overview
- **Overall:** Core functionalities for lifecycle management and workflow orchestration are implemented with agent state checking and comprehensive custom exception handling. API endpoints for interaction are available, now with centralized middleware for logging and error handling. Webhook mechanism for AgentKit integration implemented. A basic Python SDK (`opscore_sdk/`) and a CLI (`opscore_cli/`) are available. Unit tests, mock integration tests, and the **real AgentKit integration test (Task 4.2) are now passing.** Ops-Core storage layer refactored to support Redis (for integration tests) and async operations.
- **Blockers/Dependencies:** None currently. Ready for Task 4.3 (CI/CD).

## 4. Known Issues
- **Hardcoded API Key:** API key is temporarily hardcoded in `tests/conftest.py` (Task B8).
- **`httpx` Deprecation Warnings:** 6 warnings in `tests/test_middleware.py` related to `TestClient` instantiation (Task B7). Fixed 1 warning in `tests/conftest.py` related to `client.close()`.
- Test coverage for `logging_config.py`, `models.py`, `agentkit_client.py`, and `workflow.py` needs review/improvement.
- Task queue (`workflow._task_queue`) is still in-memory.
- Re-queue logic in `process_next_task` uses immediate re-queue instead of delayed backoff.

- **[2025-04-18]** Updated mock AgentKit to send webhook notifications and simulate state update callbacks.
- **[2025-04-18]** Added `GET /v1/opscore/agent/{agent_id}/state` endpoint to Ops-Core API.
- **[2025-04-18]** Refactored integration tests to use `pytest-asyncio` and `httpx`.
- **[2025-04-18]** Debugged and fixed integration test failures (Task 3.4). Resolved issues related to Docker execution context, indentation errors, type errors, missing exceptions, and exception handling logic in `api.py`, `lifecycle.py`, and `exceptions.py`.
- **[2025-04-19]** Created Python SDK (`opscore_sdk/`) with sync/async clients, models, exceptions, and unit tests using `pytest-httpx` (Task 3.1). Added `pytest-httpx` dependency. Resolved async fixture issues in tests.
- **[2025-04-19]** Created CLI application (`opscore_cli/`) using `click` and added unit tests (Task 3.2). Fixed test failures related to imports and `CliRunner` usage.
- **[2025-04-19]** Implemented API middleware for logging and error handling (`opscore/middleware.py`, Task 3.3). Refactored API routes (`opscore/api.py`) to use middleware. Added tests (`tests/test_middleware.py`). Refactored multiple test files and core modules (`exceptions.py`, `storage.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `conftest.py`) to address test failures uncovered during middleware implementation. Removed `pytest-lazy-fixture` dependency due to incompatibility. (Previous Session)
- **[2025-04-19]** Debugged Task 3.3 test failures: Fixed fixture issues in `test_middleware.py`, corrected argument passing in `test_lifecycle.py`, improved exception wrapping in `opscore/storage.py`. Reduced failures from 31 to 8. (Previous Session)
- **[2025-04-19]** Completed Task 3.3: Resolved remaining 8 test failures by correcting lock mocking in `tests/test_storage.py`, fixing inline definition handling in `opscore/api.py`, and ensuring Docker services were running for integration tests. Added Task B7 for `httpx` warnings.
- **[2025-04-19]** Completed Task 5.6: Updated `AGENTKIT_REQUIREMENTS.md` to be comprehensive, including state callbacks, dispatch endpoint, and testing notes.
- **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Setup: Cloned real AgentKit, created `docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml`, created Simulated Agent service (`tests/simulated_agent/`), created integration test file (`tests/integration/test_real_agentkit_workflow.py`).
- **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (Initial): Identified and requested fixes for AgentKit (health endpoint, webhook serialization - Issue #1). Updated tests for AgentKit fixes and Ops-Core auth requirement on GET /state. Initial tests failed due to Ops-Core 500 error.
- **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (500 Error): Diagnosed 500 error on `GET /state` as `AttributeError` due to `api.py` not handling `None` return from `lifecycle.get_state`. Fixed by adding check and raising 404.
- **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (Test Runner): Resolved issues running tests via `docker-compose run` (`FileNotFoundError`, DNS error) by switching to running `pytest` on host against services started with `docker-compose up -d`.
- **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (Docker Issues): Encountered and resolved several Docker environment issues on WSL, including a `KeyError: 'ContainerConfig'` (likely due to docker-compose v1 incompatibility with newer Docker Engine) and Docker service startup failures ("failed to load listeners: no sockets found via socket activation"). Used `docker compose` (v2) and started the Docker daemon directly as workarounds.
- **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (Agent ID Mismatch): Identified that the integration test was failing because it was polling for a stale/incorrect hardcoded agent ID, while AgentKit was registering the simulated agent with a different, dynamically generated ID. Reverted the hardcoded ID in the test.
- **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (Test Fixture Usage): Attempted to modify the test to discover the dynamically generated agent ID from AgentKit's `/v1/agents` endpoint, but encountered an `AttributeError` due to incorrect usage of the `agentkit_client` pytest async fixture. This needs to be fixed.
+ **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (Redis Implementation): Implemented Redis storage backend (`RedisStorage` class, Docker config, dependencies). Refactored `storage.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `api.py`, `conftest.py`, `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py`, `simulated_agent/main.py` to support async storage and fix related errors (NameError, async/sync issues, timing). Test now passes initial `UNKNOWN` state check but fails waiting for `idle` state.
+ **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Debugging (API Polling & Auth): Switched test polling from direct storage access to API polling. Debugged test environment issues (venv activation, missing `redis` package, missing `httpx` import). Identified API key authentication failure (401 Unauthorized) due to incorrect header format in `opscore_client` fixture. Attempts to fix the fixture were interrupted.
+ **[2025-04-20]** Task 4.2 Completion: Fixed `opscore_client` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` (import `OPSCORE_BASE_URL`, remove duplicate in test file). Fixed simulated agent state reporting payload (`tests/simulated_agent/main.py`) to include `agentId` and `timestamp`. Fixed indentation errors. Adjusted test logic (`tests/integration/test_real_agentkit_workflow.py`) to remove fixed sleep and poll directly for `idle` state, resolving race condition. Test now passes. Added backlog items B8 and B9.
