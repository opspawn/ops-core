# Project Brief: Ops-Core Python Module

## 1. Project Name and Description
- **Project Name:** Ops‑Core Python Module for Opspawn
- **Description:** The Ops‑Core module is the operational backbone of the Opsspawn ecosystem. Built to orchestrate the lifecycle and workflows of AI agents, this Python module manages state tracking, multi‑step task execution, logging, and integration with external systems. The initial implementation targets local-first development with plans for scaling into containerized and cloud environments.

## 2. Core Requirements and Goals
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a secure, scalable, and modular Python module that implements lifecycle management, workflow sequencing, and detailed debugging/logging for Ops‑Core.
- **Key Objectives:**
    - Implement mechanisms to register agents, manage their state transitions (idle, active, error), and track multi‑step workflows (Lifecycle Management).
    - Develop an extensible engine for sequencing tasks, dispatching operations, and handling error recovery (Workflow Orchestration).
    - Provide granular logging and real‑time debugging tools (Debugging & Logging).
    - Expose secure, RESTful API endpoints with robust JSON schemas for interaction with AgentKit and other components (Standardized Integration).
    - Begin with local in‑memory solutions and plan for transition to persistent storage and advanced security (Scalability & Security).

## 3. Scope
- **In Scope (Initial Phases):**
    - Core Lifecycle Management (State, Session Tracking) using in-memory storage.
    - Core Workflow Orchestration (Sequencing, Dispatching, Basic Error Handling) using JSON/YAML templates and in-memory queues.
    - Centralized Structured Logging (JSON format).
    - Basic Debugging Interface (CLI/Web TBD).
    - RESTful API Endpoints for State Update and Workflow Triggering (using FastAPI).
    - Basic API Key Authentication.
    - Unit and Integration Testing (pytest).
    - Dockerization for local development.
- **Out of Scope (Initial Phases):**
    - Persistent database integration (Redis, SQL DB).
    - Advanced cloud orchestration features (Kubernetes).
    - Distributed logging and advanced monitoring dashboards.
    - Advanced security (OAuth/SSO, RBAC).
    - Visual debugging interface.
    - Asynchronous messaging support.
    - Inter-agent collaboration features.

## 4. Long-Term Vision
- Integrate this Python module with the broader Opsspawn system—providing robust RESTful API endpoints, advanced state management, and seamless interaction with AgentKit and external tools for enterprise-grade deployments.
- Evolve into a production-ready cloud platform with managed offerings and a marketplace.
- Support ecosystem growth, advanced CI/CD, and internationalization.
