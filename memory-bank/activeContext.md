# Active Context: Ops-Core Python Module (Updated - 2025-04-20 @ 18:53)

## 1. Current Work Focus
- **Completed:** Phase 1, Phase 2, Task 3.1 (SDK), Task 3.2 (CLI), Task 3.4 (AgentKit Integration), Task 3.3 (Middleware), Task 5.6 (AgentKit Requirements Doc Update).
- **Focus:** Task 4.2 (Real AgentKit Integration Tests) - Partially complete. Implemented Redis storage backend and refactored related code to address storage visibility issues. Test now passes initial state check but fails waiting for subsequent `idle` state update.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions (This Session - 2025-04-20 17:57 - 18:53)
- **Debug Task 4.2 (Redis Implementation & Async Refactor):**
    - Approved plan to implement Redis storage for integration tests.
    - Documented detailed plan in `docs/repo/redis_implementation_plan_task_4.2.md`.
    - Added `redis` service to `docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml` and configured Ops-Core service environment variables (`OPSCORE_STORAGE_TYPE`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`). Changed Redis host port mapping to 6380 to avoid conflicts.
    - Added `redis` package to `requirements.txt`.
    - Implemented `RedisStorage` class in `opscore/storage.py` with async methods using `redis.asyncio`.
    - Refactored `opscore/storage.py` to encapsulate original logic in `InMemoryStorage` class and added `get_storage()` function for selection. Fixed `NameError` during test run.
    - Added Redis client fixture and Redis DB clearing fixture to `tests/conftest.py`. Fixed `NameError` and `DeprecationWarning` in fixtures.
    - Modified `tests/integration/test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` to poll storage directly using `get_storage()` and async methods. Set environment variables for pytest execution to ensure test uses Redis.
    - Refactored `opscore/lifecycle.py` functions (`register_agent`, `set_state`, `get_state`, `start_session`, `update_session`, `get_session`) to be `async` and `await` storage calls.
    - Refactored `opscore/api.py` endpoint handlers to `await` calls to async lifecycle functions.
    - Removed deprecated synchronous wrapper functions from `opscore/storage.py`.
    - Modified `tests/simulated_agent/main.py` to send initial `idle` state after registration and added retry logic for this initial report.
    - **Current Status:** Integration test `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` now successfully verifies the initial `UNKNOWN` state in Redis. However, it still times out waiting for the `idle` state. Ops-Core logs show the simulated agent's initial `idle` state update attempt fails with 422 before the registration webhook is processed. The retry logic added to the simulated agent did not resolve this timing issue.

## 3. Next Steps (Next Session)
- **Debug Task 4.2 (Idle State Update):** Investigate why the `idle` state update from the simulated agent is still not being correctly processed and reflected in Redis, even with retry logic. This might involve:
    - Analyzing Ops-Core logs again for the `POST /state` request handling after the registration webhook.
    - Reviewing the simulated agent's retry logic and timing.
    - Checking the Ops-Core API endpoint logic for state updates (`opscore/api.py`, `opscore/lifecycle.py`) for potential issues handling the `idle` state update specifically after registration.
- **Complete Task 4.2:** Once the `idle` state is correctly verified, ensure the full end-to-end workflow (triggering workflow, agent state transitions to "active" and then back to "idle") passes.
- **Address `httpx` Warnings:** Eventually address Task B7 related to `TestClient` instantiation in `tests/test_middleware.py`.
- **Consult `TASK.md`:** Identify next tasks after 4.2 (likely Task 4.3: CI/CD setup).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- Using Redis storage backend for the integration test environment (`docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml`).
- Ops-Core storage interaction layer (`storage.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `api.py`) refactored to be asynchronous.
- Integration test polls storage directly for state verification due to timing complexities with API polling.
- Simulated agent attempts to report initial `idle` state after registration (with retries).
- **Current Blocker:** Integration test fails waiting for `idle` state after successful `UNKNOWN` state verification in Redis. The initial `idle` state update from the simulated agent seems to fail or not be persisted correctly.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Continue following Python best practices (PEP8, type hints).
- Use FastAPI conventions.
- Maintain modularity.
- Ensure comprehensive logging.
- Write unit tests for new logic and improve coverage for existing logic.
- Use timezone-aware datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`).
- Use custom exceptions derived from `OpsCoreError` for specific error conditions.
- Use `async`/`await` for I/O bound operations, especially storage interactions.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- Implementing a new storage backend requires careful consideration of configuration (Docker, env vars), dependencies, and abstraction layers (`get_storage`).
- Refactoring synchronous code to asynchronous (`async`/`await`) requires propagating changes up the call stack (storage -> lifecycle -> api).
- Integration testing complex interactions between multiple services (Ops-Core, AgentKit, Agent, Redis) can reveal subtle timing issues and race conditions.
- Direct storage polling in tests can bypass API-level issues but might hide problems that would occur in real usage.
- Need to ensure components (like the simulated agent) handle potential failures during initial setup (like state reporting) gracefully, possibly with retry logic.
- Debugging requires analyzing logs from multiple services involved in the interaction.
- Environment variable scope is important (container vs. host test process).
