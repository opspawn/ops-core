# Active Context: Ops-Core Python Module (Updated - 2025-04-20 @ 20:29)

## 1. Current Work Focus
- **Completed:** Phase 1, Phase 2, Task 3.1 (SDK), Task 3.2 (CLI), Task 3.4 (AgentKit Integration), Task 3.3 (Middleware), Task 5.6 (AgentKit Requirements Doc Update), **Task 4.2 (Real AgentKit Integration Tests)**.
- **Focus:** Preparing for Task 4.3 (CI/CD Setup).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions (This Session - 2025-04-20 @ 20:00 - 20:29)
- **Completed Task 4.2 (Real AgentKit Integration Tests):**
    - Debugged the integration test `tests/integration/test_real_agentkit_workflow.py`.
    - Resolved `401 Unauthorized` error by fixing the `opscore_client` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` to correctly import `OPSCORE_BASE_URL` and apply the hardcoded API key header. Removed conflicting fixture definition from the test file.
    - Resolved `422 Unprocessable Entity` error from Ops-Core API during simulated agent state reporting by adding missing `agentId` and `timestamp` fields to the payload in `tests/simulated_agent/main.py`.
    - Resolved `IndentationError` in `tests/simulated_agent/main.py` introduced during the payload fix.
    - Resolved race condition where the test missed the 'UNKNOWN' state by removing a fixed `asyncio.sleep()` and adjusting the test logic to poll directly for the 'idle' state after agent discovery.
    - Resolved `SyntaxError: 'await' outside function` in `tests/integration/test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` caused by incorrect indentation during previous edits.
    - **Current Status:** The integration test `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` now passes successfully.

## 3. Next Steps (Next Session)
- **Start Task 4.3:** Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (testing, linting).
- **Address Backlog Items:**
    - **Task B8:** Implement proper environment variable loading in test suite to remove hardcoded API key.
    - **Task B9:** Investigate more robust test verification methods (alternatives to API polling).
    - **Task B7:** Address `httpx` DeprecationWarnings.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- Using Redis storage backend for the integration test environment (`docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml`).
- Ops-Core storage interaction layer (`storage.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `api.py`) is asynchronous.
- Integration test polls the Ops-Core API (`/v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/state`) for state verification.
- API key authentication uses the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header format.
- Tests must be run using the virtual environment's Python interpreter (`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest ...`).
- **Decision:** Keep API polling for state verification in the integration test for now, but added Task B9 to investigate alternatives (like direct DB inspection) for future robustness improvements.
- **Temporary Workaround:** The API key is still hardcoded in `tests/conftest.py` (Task B8 needs to address this).

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Continue following Python best practices (PEP8, type hints).
- Use FastAPI conventions.
- Maintain modularity.
- Ensure comprehensive logging.
- Write unit tests for new logic and improve coverage for existing logic.
- Use timezone-aware datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`).
- Use custom exceptions derived from `OpsCoreError` for specific error conditions.
- Use `async`/`await` for I/O bound operations, especially storage interactions.
- Ensure tests run within the correct virtual environment.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- Implementing a new storage backend requires careful consideration of configuration (Docker, env vars), dependencies, and abstraction layers (`get_storage`).
- Refactoring synchronous code to asynchronous (`async`/`await`) requires propagating changes up the call stack (storage -> lifecycle -> api).
- Integration testing complex interactions between multiple services (Ops-Core, AgentKit, Agent, Redis) can reveal subtle timing issues and race conditions.
- Direct storage polling in tests can bypass API-level issues but might hide problems that would occur in real usage. It can also lead to environment mismatches if not carefully managed.
- Need to ensure components (like the simulated agent) handle potential failures during initial setup (like state reporting) gracefully, possibly with retry logic.
- Debugging requires analyzing logs from multiple services involved in the interaction.
- Environment variable scope is important (container vs. host test process). Test fixtures need access to the correct environment variables (e.g., API keys).
- Ensuring tests run within the correct virtual environment is crucial for accessing installed dependencies (`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest ...` is more reliable than `source activate && pytest ...`).
- API authentication details (header format, key source) must match between the client (test fixture) and the server (API dependency).
- Interrupted `write_to_file` operations revert the file, requiring the operation to be retried.
- Careful code modification and verification (e.g., indentation, placement within functions) are crucial, especially when using `apply_diff`.
- API schema validation errors (like 422) require checking the exact payload being sent against the API's expectations.
- Race conditions in asynchronous tests can sometimes be mitigated by adjusting polling intervals or changing the verification strategy (e.g., waiting for a stable state instead of a transient one).
