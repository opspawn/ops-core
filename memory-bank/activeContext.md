# Active Context: Ops-Core Python Module (Updated - 2025-04-20 @ 16:38)

## 1. Current Work Focus
- **Completed:** Phase 1, Phase 2, Task 3.1 (SDK), Task 3.2 (CLI), Task 3.4 (AgentKit Integration), Task 3.3 (Middleware), Task 5.6 (AgentKit Requirements Doc Update).
- **Focus:** Task 4.2 (Real AgentKit Integration Tests) - Partially complete. Fixed original 500 error, now blocked by agent registration/discovery issue (test times out receiving 404s).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions (This Session - 2025-04-20 15:49 - 16:38)
- **Debug Task 4.2 (Agent Registration/Webhook Issue):**
    - Continued debugging the `TimeoutError` in `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` caused by repeated 404s when polling `GET /v1/opscore/agent/{agent_id}/state`.
    - Initial hypothesis: Issue in webhook processing or storage timing.
    - Examined `opscore/api.py`, `opscore/lifecycle.py`, and `opscore/storage.py`. Confirmed that `lifecycle.register_agent` *should* save registration and an initial "UNKNOWN" state via `storage.save_agent_registration` and `storage.save_agent_state`.
    - Encountered and resolved Docker environment issues preventing service startup:
        - `KeyError: 'ContainerConfig'` during `docker-compose up`. Diagnosed as likely incompatibility between older `docker-compose` (v1) and newer Docker Engine/image format.
        - `ConnectionRefusedError` when `docker-compose` attempted to connect to the Docker daemon. Diagnosed as Docker daemon not running.
        - Docker service (`docker.service`) failing to start via systemd socket activation (`failed to load listeners: no sockets found via socket activation`).
        - Performed Docker reinstallation and troubleshooting steps (checking systemd status, socket file existence/permissions, unit file contents).
        - Successfully started the Docker daemon directly (`sudo dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) as a workaround for the systemd socket activation issue.
        - Switched to using `docker compose` (v2 plugin) instead of `docker-compose` (v1).
        - Resolved a container name conflict (`Error response from daemon: Conflict...`) by removing the old container (`docker rm`).
        - Successfully started the services (`opscore`, `agentkit_real_service`, `simulated_agent`) using `docker compose up -d --build`.
    - Ran the integration test again with a diagnostic change to first poll for the "UNKNOWN" state.
    - Test still failed with `TimeoutError`, receiving 404s for the hardcoded agent ID (`39a97542-985f-4a8a-89f4-ede564f64573`).
    - Examined Ops-Core logs (`docker logs opscore_service_real`). Confirmed that the webhook was received and processed, and an agent *was* registered with a *different* dynamically generated ID (`07fa3957-a4ce-4bec-b8ed-a129d71f0922`).
    - Identified the root cause of the 404s: The test was polling for an incorrect/stale agent ID. The agent ID is dynamically generated by AgentKit.
    - Reverted the temporary hardcoded agent ID in `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py`.
    - Attempted to modify the test to discover the dynamically generated agent ID from AgentKit's `/v1/agents` endpoint using the `agentkit_client` fixture.
    - Encountered an `AttributeError: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'get'` because the test function was incorrectly trying to use the fixture object directly instead of the client instance it yields.

## 3. Next Steps (Next Session)
- **Debug Task 4.2 (Test Fixture Usage):** Fix the `AttributeError` in `test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` by correctly using the `httpx.AsyncClient` instance provided by the `agentkit_client` fixture to poll AgentKit's `/v1/agents` endpoint.
- **Debug Task 4.2 (Agent Discovery):** Ensure the test successfully discovers the dynamically generated agent ID from AgentKit.
- **Complete Task 4.2:** Once the agent ID is correctly obtained and the initial "UNKNOWN" state is verified, ensure the full end-to-end workflow (triggering workflow, agent state transitions to "active" and "idle") passes.
- **Address `httpx` Warnings:** Eventually address Task B7 related to `TestClient` instantiation in `tests/test_middleware.py`.
- **Consult `TASK.md`:** Identify next tasks after 4.2 (likely Task 4.3: CI/CD setup).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- Using separate `docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml` for real integration tests.
- Running integration tests from the host machine against services started with `docker compose up -d` is more reliable than using `docker compose run`.
- AgentKit fixes for Issue #1 are available on branch `feature/issue-1-ops-core-integration-fixes`.
- The original 500 error in `GET /state` was due to improper handling of `None` return from `lifecycle.get_state`. This is now fixed.
- **Current Blocker:** The integration test fails with an `AttributeError` when trying to discover the dynamically generated agent ID from AgentKit due to incorrect usage of the `agentkit_client` fixture.
- The Docker daemon is currently running directly (`sudo dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) as a workaround for the systemd socket activation issue on WSL. This needs to be resolved for a robust setup, but the current focus is on the integration test.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Continue following Python best practices (PEP8, type hints).
- Use FastAPI conventions.
- Maintain modularity.
- Ensure comprehensive logging.
- Write unit tests for new logic and improve coverage for existing logic.
- Use timezone-aware datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`).
- Use custom exceptions derived from `OpsCoreError` for specific error conditions.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- Core lifecycle and workflow functions are implemented with initial test coverage.
- API endpoints for core interactions are defined.
- Refactoring storage and lifecycle layers to use Pydantic models improved consistency.
- Careful attention to dependencies (like `pytest-cov`) and virtual environments is crucial.
- Mocking and async testing patterns established.
- Using `asyncio.to_thread` to bridge async/sync code where necessary (e.g., `process_next_task` calling `lifecycle.get_state`).
- Custom exception hierarchy established for more specific error handling.
- Refactored integration tests to use `pytest-asyncio` and `httpx`.
- Implemented webhook pattern for inter-service communication (mock AgentKit -> Ops-Core).
- Debugging integration tests highlighted the importance of running tests within the correct Docker network context.
- Resolved chained errors involving indentation, type errors, missing exceptions, and incorrect exception handling logic (Previous Session).
- Learned nuances of testing async fixtures with `pytest-asyncio` and `pytest-httpx`, requiring specific fixture patterns (`async with`/`yield`) and careful naming to avoid conflicts (`local_middleware_client`).
- Learned correct usage of `click.testing.CliRunner` for capturing `stderr` (`mix_stderr=False` during initialization).
- Ensured tests explicitly handle environment variables to avoid interference from the external shell environment.
- Corrected test setup logic involving function argument mismatches (`register_agent`).
- Refined exception handling in storage layer to wrap generic exceptions occurring during lock acquisition or internal operations.
- Adjusted test assertions to match actual exception messages wrapped by higher layers.
- Debugging real AgentKit integration revealed issues with health checks, webhook serialization (fixed in AgentKit branch), and Ops-Core state retrieval (500 error fixed, now 404/timeout).
- Confirmed need for API key authentication on Ops-Core `GET /state` endpoint.
- API endpoints should gracefully handle cases where underlying functions (like `lifecycle.get_state`) return `None`, typically by returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404).
- Docker environment issues on WSL (systemd socket activation, docker-compose version incompatibility) can block development and require system-level troubleshooting. Using `docker compose` (v2) is necessary with newer Docker Engine versions.
- The integration test was failing due to polling for a stale/incorrect dynamically generated agent ID. The test needs to discover the actual ID from AgentKit after registration.
- Incorrect usage of pytest async fixtures (`async_generator` vs `httpx.AsyncClient` instance) caused an `AttributeError` when attempting to use the client.
