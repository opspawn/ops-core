  – Example for state update:
    ```json
    {
      "agentId": "string",
      "timestamp": "ISO8601-date-time",
      "state": "string", // e.g., "idle", "active", "error"
      "details": {
        "errorCode": "optional string",
        "message": "optional string"
      }
    }
    ```
- **Versioning:**
