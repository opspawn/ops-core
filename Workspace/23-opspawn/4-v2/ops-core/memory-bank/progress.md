# Progress: Ops-Core Python Module

## 1. What Works (Current Status)
- **Project Setup:** The `ops-core` workspace is active. Virtual environment (`.venv`) created and dependencies installed. Git repository initialized and connected to remote.
- **Planning Context:** All initial planning documents reviewed. Memory bank initialized. Unit testing plan created.
- **Technology Selection:** FastAPI confirmed. Pytest configured with asyncio, mock, and cov plugins.
- **Core Modules Implemented:**
    - Storage (`storage.py`): In-memory implementation using models, thread-safe, uses custom exceptions. (Test coverage updated)
    - Lifecycle (`lifecycle.py`): Agent registration, state management, session tracking implemented using models and custom exceptions. (100% test coverage)
    - Workflow (`workflow.py`): Definition loading, task queuing (in-memory), agent state check before dispatching, placeholder dispatching (async, connected to client), placeholder error handling implemented, uses custom exceptions. (Test coverage updated)
    - Logging (`logging_config.py`): Structured JSON logging configured. (Test coverage needs review)
    - Models (`models.py`): Core Pydantic models defined and used. (Test coverage needs review)
    - AgentKit Client (`agentkit_client.py`): Placeholder created. (Test coverage needs review)
    - Exceptions (`exceptions.py`): Custom exception hierarchy defined.
- **API Endpoints (`api.py`):** `/health`, `/v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/state`, `/v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/workflow` implemented, using custom exceptions. (89% test coverage, needs update for exception handling tests)
- **Unit Tests:** Test suite expanded for storage, lifecycle, workflow, and API modules using pytest. Tests for lifecycle, workflow, storage updated for custom exceptions. All 91 tests passing currently.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps from `TASK.md`)
- **Phase 2 Tasks:**
    - [ ] **Task 2.9:** Develop a basic CLI or web dashboard for real‑time log inspection and filtering.
    - [ ] **Task 2.10:** Incorporate performance tracing methods like `startTrace(taskId)` and `endTrace(taskId)`.
    - [ ] **Task 2.14:** Implement Custom Exceptions. (In Progress - API tests remaining)
- **Phase 3 Tasks:**
    - [ ] Task 3.1: Integrate the Ops‑Core API endpoints with a Python SDK.
    - [ ] Task 3.2: Create a simple CLI application to interact with Ops‑Core endpoints.
    - [ ] Task 3.3: Implement middleware for structured logging and standardized error handling across endpoints.
    - [ ] Task 3.4: Ensure all endpoints interoperate seamlessly with AgentKit’s integration interfaces.
- **Phase 4 Tasks:**
    - [X] Task 4.1: Write unit tests for each subsystem using pytest. (Initial implementation complete; lifecycle coverage 100%, API coverage 89%).
    - [ ] Task 4.2: Develop integration tests simulating complete workflows. (API tests partially cover this).
    - [ ] Task 4.3: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (testing, linting).
    - [ ] Task 4.4: Perform performance and load testing on API endpoints.
    - [ ] Task 4.5: Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
- **Phase 5 Tasks:** Documentation updates (`README.md`, API docs, tutorials, config guide).
- **Backlog:** Persistent storage/queue, advanced debugging/security, async messaging, etc.

## 3. Current Status Overview
- **Overall:** Core functionalities for lifecycle management and workflow orchestration are implemented with agent state checking and initial custom exception handling. API endpoints for interaction are available. Unit tests cover major components, but API exception handling tests need updating.
- **Blockers/Dependencies:** Confirmation of AgentKit's `GET /v1/agents` endpoint details still pending for full AgentKit integration and agent discovery features.

## 4. Known Issues
- Test coverage for `logging_config.py`, `models.py`, `agentkit_client.py`, and `workflow.py` needs review/improvement, especially after exception refactoring. API test coverage needs update for exception handling.
- Task queue (`workflow._task_queue`) is still in-memory.
- Error handling refactored to use custom exceptions, but API tests need updating to verify HTTP mapping.
- Re-queue logic in `process_next_task` uses immediate re-queue instead of delayed backoff.
