# Progress: Ops-Core Python Module

## 1. What Works (Current Status)
- **Project Setup:** The `ops-core` workspace is active.
- **Planning Context:** All initial planning documents (`DevelopmentSummary.md`, `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, `agentkit_integration_for_opscore.md`) have been reviewed.
- **Memory Bank:** The core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been initialized based on the planning documents.
- **Technology Selection:** FastAPI confirmed as the web framework.
- **Initial Plan:** A detailed plan for Phase 1 (Setup) and the start of Phase 2 (Core Implementation) has been agreed upon.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps)
- **Phase 1 Tasks (from `TASK.md`): COMPLETE**
    - [X] Task 1.1: Set up Git repository structure (Assuming repo exists, focus on internal structure). (Covered by creating `opscore/`, `tests/`, `.gitignore`)
    - [X] Task 1.2: Configure local Python development environment (`venv`, `requirements.txt`). (Created `requirements.txt`, `venv` is user responsibility)
    - [X] Task 1.3: Create initial `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
    - [X] Task 1.4: (Covered by initial review) Extract Python-specific requirements.
    - [X] Task 1.5: (Covered by initial review & decision) Document and confirm tech stack.
    - [X] Create placeholder Python files for core modules within `opscore/`. (Created `api.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `workflow.py`, `logging_config.py`, `storage.py`, `models.py`)
    - [X] Created `.env` placeholder.
- **Phase 2 Tasks (Initial):**
    - [X] Implement basic in-memory storage (`storage.py`). (Placeholder exists, logger integrated)
    - [X] Implement foundational Lifecycle Management functions (`lifecycle.py`). (`register_agent`, `set_state`, `get_state` implemented using storage/models)
    - [X] Implement foundational Workflow Sequencing functions (`workflow.py`). (Implemented: `load_template`, `create`, `get_def`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `dispatch`, `process_next`)
    - [X] Configure basic structured logging (`logging_config.py`). (Created and integrated into core modules)
    - [X] Set up FastAPI app and implement the state update endpoint (`api.py`). (Implemented, connected to `lifecycle.set_state`, uses models, logging integrated)

## 3. Current Status Overview
- **Overall:** Project initialization phase. Ready to begin coding the foundational structure.
- **Blockers/Dependencies:** Confirmation of AgentKit's `GET /v1/agents` endpoint details is pending but not blocking initial setup.

## 4. Known Issues
- None at this stage.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **[2025-04-17]** Confirmed use of FastAPI over Flask.
- **[2025-04-17]** Initialized Memory Bank structure and content based on planning docs.
