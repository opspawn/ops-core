# Progress: Ops-Core Python Module

## 1. What Works (Current Status)
- **Project Setup:** The `ops-core` workspace is active. Virtual environment (`.venv`) created and dependencies installed. Git repository initialized and connected to remote.
- **Planning Context:** All initial planning documents reviewed. Memory bank initialized. Unit testing plan created.
- **Technology Selection:** FastAPI confirmed. Pytest configured with asyncio, mock, and cov plugins.
- **Core Modules Implemented:**
    - Storage (`storage.py`): In-memory implementation using models, thread-safe, uses custom exceptions. (Test coverage updated)
    - Lifecycle (`lifecycle.py`): Agent registration, state management, session tracking implemented using models and custom exceptions. (100% test coverage)
    - Workflow (`workflow.py`): Definition loading, task queuing (in-memory), agent state check before dispatching, placeholder dispatching (async, connected to client), placeholder error handling implemented, uses custom exceptions. (Test coverage updated)
    - Logging (`logging_config.py`): Structured JSON logging configured. (Test coverage needs review)
    - Models (`models.py`): Core Pydantic models defined and used. (Test coverage needs review)
    - AgentKit Client (`agentkit_client.py`): Placeholder created. (Test coverage needs review)
    - Exceptions (`exceptions.py`): Custom exception hierarchy defined and fully integrated with all core modules.
- **API Endpoints (`api.py`):** `/health`, `POST /v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/state`, `GET /v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/state`, `/v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/workflow`, `POST /v1/opscore/internal/agent/notify` implemented, using custom exceptions with proper HTTP status code mappings. (Test coverage needs update)
- **Unit Tests:** Test suite expanded for storage, lifecycle, workflow, and API modules using pytest. Tests for lifecycle, workflow, storage updated for custom exceptions. (Need to re-run after recent changes).
- **Integration Tests (Mock AgentKit):** Tests rewritten (`tests/test_agentkit_integration.py`) using `pytest-asyncio` and `httpx` to cover webhook registration and state update callbacks. **Currently failing with ReadTimeout.**

## 2. What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps from `TASK.md`)
- **Phase 2 Tasks:**
    - [ ] **Task 2.9:** Develop a basic CLI or web dashboard for real‑time log inspection and filtering.
    - [ ] **Task 2.10:** Incorporate performance tracing methods like `startTrace(taskId)` and `endTrace(taskId)`.
    - [X] **Task 2.14:** Implement Custom Exceptions. (Completed - 2025-04-17)
- **Phase 3 Tasks:**
   - [ ] Task 3.4: Ensure all endpoints interoperate seamlessly with AgentKit’s integration interfaces. (Partially Complete: Webhook mechanism implemented, tests failing - 2025-04-18)
   - [ ] Task 3.1: Integrate the Ops‑Core API endpoints with a Python SDK.
   - [ ] Task 3.2: Create a simple CLI application to interact with Ops‑Core endpoints.
    - [ ] Task 3.3: Implement middleware for structured logging and standardized error handling across endpoints.
- **Phase 4 Tasks:**
    - [X] Task 4.1: Write unit tests for each subsystem using pytest. (Initial implementation complete; lifecycle coverage 100%, API coverage 89%).
   - [ ] Task 4.2: Develop integration tests simulating complete workflows. (Webhook/state update tests implemented but failing).
   - [ ] Task 4.3: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (testing, linting).
    - [ ] Task 4.4: Perform performance and load testing on API endpoints.
    - [ ] Task 4.5: Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
- **Phase 5 Tasks:** Documentation updates (`README.md`, API docs, tutorials, config guide).
- **Backlog:** Persistent storage/queue, advanced debugging/security, async messaging, etc.

## 3. Current Status Overview
- **Overall:** Core functionalities for lifecycle management and workflow orchestration are implemented with agent state checking and comprehensive custom exception handling. API endpoints for interaction are available. Webhook mechanism for AgentKit integration implemented.
- **Blockers/Dependencies:** Integration tests for AgentKit interaction (webhook registration, state update callbacks) are currently failing with `httpx.ReadTimeout`. Needs debugging. Requirement for AgentKit webhook capability documented.

## 4. Known Issues
- **Integration Tests Failing:** `tests/test_agentkit_integration.py` tests fail with `httpx.ReadTimeout`.
- Test coverage for `logging_config.py`, `models.py`, `agentkit_client.py`, and `workflow.py` needs review/improvement.
- Task queue (`workflow._task_queue`) is still in-memory.
- Re-queue logic in `process_next_task` uses immediate re-queue instead of delayed backoff.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
