# Active Context: Ops-Core Python Module (Updated - 2025-04-19 @ 22:39)

## 1. Current Work Focus
- **Completed:** Phase 1, Phase 2, Task 3.1 (SDK), Task 3.2 (CLI), Task 3.4 (AgentKit Integration), **Task 3.3 (Middleware)**.
- **Focus:** Proceeding to next tasks (likely Phase 4/5 or Backlog).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions (This Session - 2025-04-19 21:59 - 22:39)
- **Task 3.3 (Completed): Implement Middleware & Resolve Test Failures:**
    - **Debugged Remaining 8 Test Failures:**
        - **Storage Tests (5):** Resolved `Failed: DID NOT RAISE StorageError` in `tests/test_storage.py`. Root cause was incorrect mocking of `threading.Lock` instances. Corrected tests to patch the lock instance itself and configure its `__enter__` method to simulate errors within the `with` statement context.
        - **API Test (1):** Resolved `AssertionError: mock not called` in `tests/test_api.py` (`test_trigger_workflow_success_with_inline_def`). Root cause was incorrect logic in `opscore/api.py` that relied on `storage.read_workflow_definition` raising an exception instead of returning `None`. Corrected API logic to check the return value directly before attempting to save an inline definition.
        - **Integration Tests (2):** Resolved `ConnectError` in `tests/test_agentkit_integration.py`. Root cause was the required Docker services (`opscore`, `mock-agentkit`) not running. Started services using `docker-compose up -d`.
    - **Verification:** Ran the full test suite (`pytest`), resulting in 149 passed tests, confirming fixes and no regressions. Identified 6 non-critical `httpx` deprecation warnings in `tests/test_middleware.py` to be addressed later (added Task B7).
    - **Status:** Task 3.3 is complete.

## 3. Next Steps (Next Session)
- **Consult `TASK.md`:** Identify the next highest priority incomplete task (likely Task 2.9, 2.10, 4.2, 4.3, or Phase 5).
- **Address `httpx` Warnings:** Eventually address Task B7 related to `TestClient` instantiation in `tests/test_middleware.py`.
- **Refine Workflow Definition:** Define and validate the schema for `WorkflowDefinition.tasks` more strictly in `models.py`. (Deferred)
- **Refine Re-queue Logic:** Implement proper delay/backoff for re-queuing tasks when agents are busy (currently immediate re-queue). (Deferred)

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Test Coverage:** Test coverage needs re-evaluation now that Task 3.3 is complete.
- **AgentKit Endpoint Dependency:** Webhook approach remains.
- **`httpx` Warnings:** Deprecation warnings in `tests/test_middleware.py` are noted but deferred (Task B7).

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Continue following Python best practices (PEP8, type hints).
- Use FastAPI conventions.
- Maintain modularity.
- Ensure comprehensive logging.
- Write unit tests for new logic and improve coverage for existing logic.
- Use timezone-aware datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`).
- Use custom exceptions derived from `OpsCoreError` for specific error conditions.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- Core lifecycle and workflow functions are implemented with initial test coverage.
- API endpoints for core interactions are defined.
- Refactoring storage and lifecycle layers to use Pydantic models improved consistency.
- Careful attention to dependencies (like `pytest-cov`) and virtual environments is crucial.
- Mocking and async testing patterns established.
- Using `asyncio.to_thread` to bridge async/sync code where necessary (e.g., `process_next_task` calling `lifecycle.get_state`).
- Custom exception hierarchy established for more specific error handling.
- Refactored integration tests to use `pytest-asyncio` and `httpx`.
- Implemented webhook pattern for inter-service communication (mock AgentKit -> Ops-Core).
- Debugging integration tests highlighted the importance of running tests within the correct Docker network context.
- Resolved chained errors involving indentation, type errors, missing exceptions, and incorrect exception handling logic (Previous Session).
- Learned nuances of testing async fixtures with `pytest-asyncio` and `pytest-httpx`, requiring specific fixture patterns (`async with`/`yield`) and careful naming to avoid conflicts (`local_middleware_client`).
- Learned correct usage of `click.testing.CliRunner` for capturing `stderr` (`mix_stderr=False` during initialization).
- Ensured tests explicitly handle environment variables to avoid interference from the external shell environment.
- Corrected test setup logic involving function argument mismatches (`register_agent`).
- Refined exception handling in storage layer to wrap generic exceptions occurring during lock acquisition or internal operations.
- Adjusted test assertions to match actual exception messages wrapped by higher layers.
