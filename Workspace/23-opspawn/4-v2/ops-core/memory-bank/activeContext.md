# Active Context: Ops-Core Python Module (Updated - 2025-04-20 @ 14:59)

## 1. Current Work Focus
- **Completed:** Phase 1, Phase 2, Task 3.1 (SDK), Task 3.2 (CLI), Task 3.4 (AgentKit Integration), Task 3.3 (Middleware), Task 5.6 (AgentKit Requirements Doc Update).
- **Focus:** Task 4.2 (Real AgentKit Integration Tests) - Partially complete, currently blocked.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions (This Session - 2025-04-20 12:41 - 14:59)
- **Task 4.2 (Partially Completed): Develop integration tests simulating complete workflows (Real AgentKit)**
    - **Environment Setup:**
        - Cloned the real AgentKit repository (`https://github.com/opspawn/agentkit`) into `../agentkit`.
        - Moved miscellaneous documentation files from root to `docs/repo/`.
        - Created `docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml` to define services for Ops-Core, the real AgentKit (built from `../agentkit`), and a new Simulated Agent.
        - Created `tests/simulated_agent/main.py` (basic FastAPI app) and `tests/simulated_agent/Dockerfile`.
        - Created `tests/integration/test_real_agentkit_workflow.py` with fixtures and initial test structure.
    - **Initial Test Run & Debugging:**
        - First run failed due to AgentKit missing `/health` endpoint. Updated test to check AgentKit's `/` endpoint.
        - Identified AgentKit webhook serialization error (`TypeError: Object of type AgentMetadata is not JSON serializable`). Created `AGENTKIT_INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS_V2.md` and logged GitHub issue #1 in `opspawn/agentkit`.
        - AgentKit team provided fixes on branch `feature/issue-1-ops-core-integration-fixes`. Checked out this branch in `../agentkit`.
        - Reverted test health check to use `/health` for AgentKit.
        - Second run failed due to `401 Unauthorized` when polling Ops-Core state. Updated `poll_for_agent_state` in test file to include `Authorization` header.
        - Third run failed due to `500 Internal Server Error` when polling Ops-Core state (`GET /v1/opscore/agent/{agent_id}/state`).
    - **Status:** Task 4.2 setup is complete, but the test is blocked by an internal server error within Ops-Core's state retrieval endpoint. Further investigation requires Ops-Core logs.

## 3. Next Steps (Next Session)
- **Debug Task 4.2:** Investigate the root cause of the `500 Internal Server Error` on Ops-Core's `GET /v1/opscore/agent/{agent_id}/state` endpoint by examining Ops-Core service logs. Fix the underlying issue in Ops-Core.
- **Complete Task 4.2:** Re-run integration tests and ensure the full end-to-end workflow passes.
- **Address `httpx` Warnings:** Eventually address Task B7 related to `TestClient` instantiation in `tests/test_middleware.py`.
- **Consult `TASK.md`:** Identify next tasks after 4.2 (likely Task 4.3: CI/CD setup).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- Using separate `docker-compose.real-agentkit.yml` for real integration tests.
- Integration tests require a Simulated Agent service.
- AgentKit fixes for Issue #1 are available on branch `feature/issue-1-ops-core-integration-fixes`.
- Current blocker is an internal error in Ops-Core's `get_agent_state` endpoint/logic.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Continue following Python best practices (PEP8, type hints).
- Use FastAPI conventions.
- Maintain modularity.
- Ensure comprehensive logging.
- Write unit tests for new logic and improve coverage for existing logic.
- Use timezone-aware datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`).
- Use custom exceptions derived from `OpsCoreError` for specific error conditions.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- Core lifecycle and workflow functions are implemented with initial test coverage.
- API endpoints for core interactions are defined.
- Refactoring storage and lifecycle layers to use Pydantic models improved consistency.
- Careful attention to dependencies (like `pytest-cov`) and virtual environments is crucial.
- Mocking and async testing patterns established.
- Using `asyncio.to_thread` to bridge async/sync code where necessary (e.g., `process_next_task` calling `lifecycle.get_state`).
- Custom exception hierarchy established for more specific error handling.
- Refactored integration tests to use `pytest-asyncio` and `httpx`.
- Implemented webhook pattern for inter-service communication (mock AgentKit -> Ops-Core).
- Debugging integration tests highlighted the importance of running tests within the correct Docker network context.
- Resolved chained errors involving indentation, type errors, missing exceptions, and incorrect exception handling logic (Previous Session).
- Learned nuances of testing async fixtures with `pytest-asyncio` and `pytest-httpx`, requiring specific fixture patterns (`async with`/`yield`) and careful naming to avoid conflicts (`local_middleware_client`).
- Learned correct usage of `click.testing.CliRunner` for capturing `stderr` (`mix_stderr=False` during initialization).
- Ensured tests explicitly handle environment variables to avoid interference from the external shell environment.
- Corrected test setup logic involving function argument mismatches (`register_agent`).
- Refined exception handling in storage layer to wrap generic exceptions occurring during lock acquisition or internal operations.
- Adjusted test assertions to match actual exception messages wrapped by higher layers.
- Debugging real AgentKit integration revealed issues with health checks, webhook serialization (fixed in AgentKit branch), and Ops-Core state retrieval (current blocker).
- Confirmed need for API key authentication on Ops-Core `GET /state` endpoint.
