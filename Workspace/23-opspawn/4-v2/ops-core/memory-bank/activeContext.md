# Active Context: Ops-Core Python Module (Updated - 2025-04-17 @ 18:26)

## 1. Current Work Focus
- **Completed:** Phase 1 (Initialization & Research), Phase 2 foundational components (Lifecycle, Workflow, Storage, Logging, Models, API state endpoint), Task 2.4 (Session Tracking), Task 2.7 (Error Handling Placeholders), AgentKit Client Placeholder, Dispatcher Connection, Task 4.1 (Initial Unit Tests).
- **Focus:** Implementing core features and establishing initial test coverage.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions (This Session)
- **Lifecycle:** Implemented `start_session`, `update_session`, `get_session` in `lifecycle.py` (Task 2.4). Refactored existing functions to use models consistently.
- **Workflow:** Updated error handling placeholders (`handle_task_failure`, `retry_task`, `fallback_task`) in `workflow.py` (Task 2.7). Connected `dispatch_task` to the AgentKit client placeholder and made relevant functions async. Refactored `create_workflow` and `get_workflow_definition` for model/storage consistency.
- **AgentKit Client:** Created placeholder `opscore/agentkit_client.py` with async functions for dispatching tasks and getting agent info.
- **API:** Implemented workflow trigger endpoint (`POST /v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/workflow`) in `api.py` (completing Task 2.11).
- **Models:** Added `WorkflowTriggerRequest`, `WorkflowTriggerResponse`. Updated `WorkflowSession`, `AgentInfo`, `AgentState`, `Task` models with timezone-aware datetime defaults. Added `model_validator` to `WorkflowTriggerRequest`.
- **Storage:** Refactored storage functions to consistently use and return Pydantic models. Implemented `create_session`, `read_session`, `update_session_data`, `delete_session`. Updated datetime usage.
- **Testing:** Added `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-mock`, `pytest-cov` to `requirements.txt`. Created `tests/conftest.py` with fixtures. Implemented initial unit tests for `storage`, `lifecycle`, and `workflow` modules in `tests/` directory (Task 4.1). Fixed test failures and deprecation warnings. Added 80% coverage goal to `unit_testing_plan.md`.
- **Environment:** Created `.venv` and installed dependencies.
- **Testing (Refinement):** Added tests for error handling paths in `opscore/lifecycle.py`, increasing its coverage from 76% to 100% (Refinement of Task 4.1). Fixed test failures related to mocking and serialization.

 - **API Testing:** Created `tests/test_api.py` and implemented tests for `/health`, `/v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/state`, and `/v1/opscore/agent/{agentId}/workflow` endpoints using `TestClient` and `unittest.mock.patch`. Achieved 89% coverage for `opscore/api.py`. Fixed `NameError` in `api.py` and assertion errors in tests. (Refinement of Task 4.1 / Part of Task 4.2).
+ - **Workflow (Agent State Check):** Implemented agent state checking in `workflow.process_next_task` using `asyncio.to_thread` to call the synchronous `lifecycle.get_state`. Tasks are now only dispatched if the agent state is 'idle'; otherwise, they are re-enqueued (basic re-queue for now) or failed if the state cannot be determined. Added corresponding unit tests in `tests/test_workflow.py`.

## 3. Next Steps (Next Session)
- **Implement Custom Exceptions:** Define and use custom exceptions (`exceptions.py`) for better error handling. (Next Task)
- **Refine Workflow Definition:** Define and validate the schema for `WorkflowDefinition.tasks` more strictly in `models.py`.
- **Refine Re-queue Logic:** Implement proper delay/backoff for re-queuing tasks when agents are busy (currently immediate re-queue).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Test Coverage:** `lifecycle.py` coverage is 100%. `api.py` coverage is 89%. Overall coverage is significantly improved but can be further enhanced, especially for `agentkit_client.py` and `logging_config.py`.
- **AgentKit Endpoint Dependency:** `GET /v1/agents` endpoint confirmation still pending for full AgentKit integration.
- **Persistent Queue:** The task queue (`_task_queue` in `workflow.py`) remains in-memory.
- **Error Handling:** Placeholder error handling needs to be made more robust. Custom exceptions are needed.
- **Agent State Check:** Implemented in `process_next_task`. Uses `asyncio.to_thread` for sync `get_state` call. Re-queues if not idle, fails if state unknown.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences
- Continue following Python best practices (PEP8, type hints).
- Use FastAPI conventions.
- Maintain modularity.
- Ensure comprehensive logging.
- Write unit tests for new logic and improve coverage for existing logic.
- Use timezone-aware datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`).

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
- Core lifecycle and workflow functions are implemented with initial test coverage.
- API endpoints for core interactions are defined.
- Refactoring storage and lifecycle layers to use Pydantic models improved consistency.
- Careful attention to dependencies (like `pytest-cov`) and virtual environments is crucial.
- Mocking and async testing patterns established.
- Using `asyncio.to_thread` to bridge async/sync code where necessary (e.g., `process_next_task` calling `lifecycle.get_state`).
