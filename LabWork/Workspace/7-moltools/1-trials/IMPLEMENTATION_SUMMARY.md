## External Tools Integration Framework

### Task 27: External Tools Integration Framework (Completed)

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive external tools integration framework for MolTools with the following components:

#### Core Infrastructure
- Created the `external_tools` module structure with proper organization
- Implemented configuration handling through `config.py`
- Added utility functions for file and process operations in `utils.py`

#### Workspace Management
- Implemented the `WorkspaceManager` class for temporary directory management
- Added file tracking and retention policies
- Created cleanup functionality with configurable patterns
- Implemented context manager support for automatic cleanup

#### Base Integration Framework
- Created the abstract `BaseExternalTool` class defining the standard interface
- Implemented executable resolution with environment variable support
- Added subprocess handling with proper error management
- Created a standard lifecycle: validate → prepare → execute → process

#### MSI2NAMD Tool Integration
- Implemented `MSI2NAMDTool` for converting Material Studio files to NAMD format
- Added input validation and preparation
- Implemented command generation with all necessary parameters
- Added output file handling with proper tracking

#### Pipeline Integration
- Added `convert_to_namd()` method to MolecularPipeline
- Implemented output file tracking in pipeline state
- Maintained method chaining capability
- Added proper error handling and recovery

#### CLI Integration
- Added convert-to-namd subcommand 
- Implemented appropriate arguments (residue name, parameter file, etc.)
- Added workspace management options
- Ensured proper error reporting

#### Testing
- Created unit tests for workspace management
- Added tests for the base framework
- Implemented integration tests with mocking
- Validated the pipeline integration

### Next Steps for External Tools Framework

1. Implement more external tool integrations:
   - PDB2PQR for electrostatics calculations
   - Reduce for hydrogen addition
   - OpenMM for molecular dynamics
   - Gaussian for quantum calculations

## File Mode Deprecation Plan

### Task 28: File Mode Deprecation (Completed)

We have implemented a comprehensive deprecation plan for the file-based API:

1. **Deprecation Flags and Constants**
   - Added `FILE_MODE_DEPRECATED = True` to config.py
   - Added `FILE_MODE_REMOVAL_VERSION = "2.0.0"` to config.py
   - Created `show_file_mode_deprecation_warning()` function

2. **Deprecation Messages**
   - Added warnings in CLI when `--file-mode` flag is used
   - Added deprecation notices to docstrings in all legacy modules
   - Updated function signatures with detailed migration examples
   - Updated README.md with deprecation timeline and notice

3. **Migration Guide**
   - Created a comprehensive migration guide document
   - Added examples for converting file-based code to object-based code
   - Documented all benefits of the object-based approach

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Marked all file mode examples as deprecated
   - Added migration path information
   - Ensured all new examples use object mode only

The file-based approach is now clearly marked as deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.0. Users are provided with clear migration paths and examples to help them transition to the object-based pipeline API.
