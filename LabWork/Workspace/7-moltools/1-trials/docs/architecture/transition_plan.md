# Object-Based Architecture: Transition Plan

This document outlines the transition plan from the current file-based architecture to the new object-based architecture.

## Current Architecture (File-Based)

The current architecture follows a strictly file-based approach:

```
Input Files → Parser → Transform → Writer → Output Files
```

Each transformation operates directly on input files and produces output files.

## Target Architecture (Object-Based Pipeline)

The new architecture centers around System objects that persist through transformations:

```
Input Files → System Object → Pipeline Transformations → Output Files
```

## Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Core System Class Enhancements

1. **Enhance System Class**
   - Add `update_ff_types()` method
   - Add `update_charges()` method
   - Add `to_files()` method for direct file output
   - Create `system_from_files()` factory method
   - Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints

2. **Unit Testing**
   - Create tests for all new System methods
   - Verify backward compatibility

### Phase 2: MolecularPipeline Implementation

1. **Create Pipeline Module**
   - Implement `MolecularPipeline` class with fluent API
   - Add intermediate file output for debugging
   - Delegate to System methods for transformations
   - Implement progress tracking and logging

2. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Create unit tests for pipeline
   - Document example usage

### Phase 3: Transform Transformer Modules

1. **Refactor Existing Transformers**
   - Update `update_ff.py` to include object-based methods
   - Update `update_charges.py` to include object-based methods
   - Update `grid.py` to include object-based methods

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Create a `legacy` package
   - Move file-based functions to the legacy package
   - Create compatibility layer

### Phase 4: CLI and Integration Updates

1. **CLI Updates**
   - Add `--object-mode` flag to subcommands
   - Add `--debug-output` flag for intermediate files
   - Update help text and documentation

2. **Example Scripts**
   - Create new examples demonstrating object-based approach
   - Create examples that chain multiple transformations

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

To ensure backward compatibility:

1. **Preserve Existing API**
   - Maintain all current function signatures
   - File-based functions will continue to work as before

2. **Transparency for Users**
   - File-based approach remains the default
   - Users can opt-in to object-based approach with `--object-mode` flag

3. **Internal Implementation Changes**
   - Adapt file-based functions to use the new object model internally
   - Route file-based calls through the object model for code reuse

4. **Documentation**
   - Clearly document both approaches
   - Provide migration guides
   - Show examples of converting file-based code to object-based

## Transition Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (Core System Enhancements)**: Complete by end of week 1
2. **Phase 2 (MolecularPipeline)**: Complete by end of week 2
3. **Phase 3 (Transformer Refactoring)**: Complete by end of week 3
4. **Phase 4 (CLI and Integration)**: Complete by end of week 4

## Testing Strategy

Each phase will include:
1. Unit tests for new functionality
2. Integration tests with existing code
3. End-to-end tests with sample workflows
4. Backward compatibility tests

## Validation Criteria

The transition will be considered successful when:
1. All existing functionality works with both approaches
2. New object-based API enables chained transformations
3. Test coverage meets or exceeds current coverage
4. Documentation clearly explains both approaches
5. Performance is maintained or improved
