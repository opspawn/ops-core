# PLANNING.md

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name and Description
- **Project Name:** Ops‑Core Python Module for Opspawn  
- **Description:** The Ops‑Core module is the operational backbone of the Opsspawn ecosystem. Built to orchestrate the lifecycle and workflows of AI agents, this Python module manages state tracking, multi‑step task execution, logging, and integration with external systems. The initial implementation targets local-first development with plans for scaling into containerized and cloud environments.

### Objective
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a secure, scalable, and modular Python module that implements lifecycle management, workflow sequencing, and detailed debugging/logging for Ops‑Core.
- **Long-Term Vision:** Integrate this Python module with the broader Opsspawn system—providing robust RESTful API endpoints, advanced state management, and seamless interaction with AgentKit and external tools for enterprise-grade deployments.

## 2. Vision & Objectives

### Vision Statement
- **Vision:** To create a robust, Python‑based Ops‑Core that enables efficient multi‑agent lifecycle management and workflow orchestration, empowering Opsspawn to scale from local prototypes to enterprise-grade operations.

### Key Objectives
- **Lifecycle Management:** Implement mechanisms to register agents, manage their state transitions (idle, active, error), and track multi‑step workflows.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Develop an extensible engine for sequencing tasks, dispatching operations, and handling error recovery.
- **Debugging & Logging:** Provide granular logging and real‑time debugging tools to facilitate troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
- **Standardized Integration:** Expose secure, RESTful API endpoints with robust JSON schemas for smooth interaction with AgentKit and other system components.
- **Scalability & Security:** Begin with local in‑memory solutions and plan for transition to persistent storage and advanced security features as the module matures.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Lifecycle Management Subsystem:**  
  - Manages agent state and session tracking.
  - Implements functions such as `setState(agentId, newState, details)`, `registerAgent(agentDetails)`, and session management methods.
- **Workflow Sequencing and Orchestration:**  
  - Coordinates multi‑step tasks through workflow templates.
  - Contains methods like `createWorkflow(workflowTemplate)`, `enqueueTask(taskData)`, and dispatching routines.
- **Debugging and Logging Subsystem:**  
  - Captures detailed logs and provides interfaces for real‑time monitoring.
  - Implements operations such as `logOperation(operation, context)` and supports performance tracing.
- **Integration Endpoints:**  
  - Provides RESTful API endpoints (using Flask or FastAPI) to update state and trigger workflows.
  - Follows strict JSON schema validation and standardized error handling.

### Deliverable Documents
- **Architecture Analysis Document:** Includes UML/sequence diagrams demonstrating interactions between lifecycle management, orchestration, and API endpoints.
- **Adaptation Plan:** Guides future scalability—from local, in‑memory deployments to cloud-based persistent storage and advanced orchestration.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Web Framework:** Flask or FastAPI for RESTful API development.
- **Testing Tools:** pytest for unit and integration tests.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose for local multi‑module simulations.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and automated deployments.
- **Data Format:** JSON (using defined schemas for API inputs/outputs).

### Constraints & Considerations
- **Local-First Development:** The module should run efficiently on local workstations to allow rapid prototyping and testing.
- **Security & Data Validation:** Emphasize secure coding practices and input validations to protect endpoints.
- **Interoperability:** Adhere to industry standards and JSON schemas for smooth future integration with AgentKit and external systems.
- **Non-goals:** Advanced features like cloud orchestration, persistent database integration, and distributed logging are planned for later stages after core functionality is stable.
